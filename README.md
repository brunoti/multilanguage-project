# Multilanguage Project

## Introduction

The idea is to write the same software in as many languages both browsers and my mind can handle. But only a simple JS for now.

## Using the project

##### 1 - Install dependencies
``yarn install``

##### 2 - Run parcel server
``yarn start``

##### Optional - Run tests *in the future*
``yarn test``
